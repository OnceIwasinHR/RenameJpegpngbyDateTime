# RenameJpegpngbyDateTime
Issue: large amount of photos downloaded from icloud, names are messed up and having issue during album creation on local disc.  Solution: use this script to update all names, based on datetime taken+append if multiple taken on same date.
Ensure to update the path where all pictuers are originally extracted in local hard drive. The photos must have date_time parameters with information *can be verified by right click on the downloaded photos - view properties.
